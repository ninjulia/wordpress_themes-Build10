## [Learn to Create WordPress Themes by Building 10 Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-create-wordpress-themes-by-building-10-projects/)

There were only 9 WordPress Themes provided in this course, but it still provided a volume of sample projects that I was looking for. Following along with the instructor, I turned static comps into working HTML/CSS pages and converted those to WordPress templates. The course leveraged a variety of front-end frameworks, implemented custom widgets, and provided direction on creating a custom plugin.

First and foremost, these are intended for code practice, and the designs reflect that. The Simple and Advanced themes in particular are bearly more than HTML pages with a WordPress loop. On the code side, there's still a lot of optimizations that would need to be done before client hand-off.

Overall, I enjoyed the learning process and seeing how WordPress data could be leveraged to build fully customizable pages and sections. I particularly enjoyed working with the Bootstrap framework to create a site. Leveraging the navwalker script allowed me to quickly style navigation, without having to overwrite existing WordPress styles.
